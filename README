Goals:
Using any test automation framework, automate the following 
(Do not use any app that will just record and play actions):
    Test 1:
        - Start at "https://www.google.com/"
        - Find a way to go to "https://www.youtube.com/" by normal user
          interactions such as doing searches through the search engine
          and clicking links
        - The test should do a final check to check if it did land on
          "https://www.youtube.com/" and fail if it did not

    Test 2:
        - Start at "https://www.youtube.com/"
        - Find a way to click on the first video (top-left)
        - After clicking on the first video, click on the youtube logo to
          go back to youtube's home page
        - The test should do a final check to check if it did land on
          "https://www.youtube.com/" and fail if it did not
